## Why This Roundup?

Since we concluded the [#30DaysOfSWA](roadmap) series in May/June 2022, we've noticed many of you continuing to visit this site for updates. At the same time, we've seen new posts published on the [#staticwebapps tag on dev.to](https://dev.to/t/staticwebapps) and on [Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/bg-p/AppsonAzureBlog/label-name/Static%20Web%20Apps) blogs. And we've seen learning events shared [via tweets @AzureStaticApps](https://twitter.com/AzureStaticApps) that many of you may not be aware of. 

So we thought - why not _round up_ all the SWA news and activities each month, and make them available in a single post for convenient reading. The result: **This Month In SWA** - a blog post that we will publish on the last Wednesday of each month. The kind of content we hope to feature includes:

 * üóì | ** Events**: Past and Upcoming, featuring SWA talks or training opportunities.
 * üì¢ | **Announcements**: Latest news or updates from the Product and Engineering teams.
 * üëÄ | **Content Updates**: New articles, tutorials or samples authored by Microsoft developers.
 * üêù | **Community Buzz**: New articles, tutorials or samples authored by Community developers 
 * üåü | **Spotlight**: Featuring a project or person that makes a difference to SWA developers.
