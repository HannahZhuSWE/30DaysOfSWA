## First Stop - SWA Anniversary Highlights

![](../static/img/swanniversary.png)
We recently celebrated the [#SWAanniversary](https://www.azurestaticwebapps.dev/blog/swanniversary?WT.mc_id=30daysofswa-61155-cxall) on 19th and 20th May to commemorate a year of Static Web App's **General Availability**! A fun-filled activity featuring **top community speakers, launch of [General Availability of SWA CLI](https://aka.ms/swa-cli-ga?WT.mc_id=30daysofswa-61155-cxall), and many more feature demos!**üöÄ

## Week 1: Core Concepts

Week 1 was the foundational week, focusing on what Azure Static Web Apps is, how to build, deploy, preview, customize APIs etc. This is where a Static Web App newbie earns the title of a **"Successful SWA voyager"**! Every blog comes with a cute little exercise at the bottom which gives a compact hands-on experience of using Static Web Apps üòÑ 


**The best part?** Every blog has a visual narrative of what we cover, and some of them also feature video lessons! Do give us a shoutout if you (_like me_) are a firm believer of visual learning!‚ù§Ô∏è
